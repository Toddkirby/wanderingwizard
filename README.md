# Wandering Wizard

## Introduction

The board is randomly generated each time you refresh the page and hit the Start Game button, the goal is to get the wizard to the bottom of the 100x100 grid of hazards as safely as possible! Be sure to dodge the lava!

## Gameplay

The game is designed around the use of the arrow keys and involing any of the arrow keys will begin the wizards journey to the bottom! Bear in mind is health and move pool as he will either get too tired or die along his path! this game is unforgiving! To win is to get to the lil red stop sign directly below the wizards start spot!
